A comprehensive Figma design system for the FoodFusion application, showcasing UI/UX implementation and interactive prototyping.
This project translates my existing Angular-based food delivery application into a structured Figma design to demonstrate modern interface design principles.

Key Features:
1. Comprehensive User Flow: Designed interactive prototypes for the entire user journey
2. Component-Based Design: Implemented reusable components for consistent visual language
3. Design Variables: Established design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing to maintain design consistency
4. 9-Category Food Selection: Intuitive cuisine categorization system with visual hierarchy
5. User Authentication: Clean, user-friendly login and signup screens
6. Interactive Rating System: Simple yet engaging rating interface with confirmation experience
7. Shopping Cart Experience: Thoughtfully designed cart interaction and checkout flow

This project demonstrates my ability to create cohesive design systems while translating existing web applications into structured Figma designs, highlighting both technical implementation and user-centered design thinking.
